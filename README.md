Created a basic HTML structure, with a container div and individual slide divs, each containing an image and slide number then applied CSS styles to format  the slideshow , making sure they looked visually appealing to the user.e.g hiding all slides initially.Went ahead to use javascript to track the current slide, creating functions to increment and decrement the slide number, and writing a function to update slide visibility. 
The problem i came across was the issue of the slideshows not wrapping around meaning, when the user come to the end of the slide show they might click next not knowing they had reached the end. This was solved by using conditional statements to check if the next or previous slide exceeded the bounds of the available slides. If it did, it would be wrapped to the first or last slide. The images for the slideshow are not being diplayed on the screen.
